## Introduction

The École Centrale de Lille is one of the top schools of engineering in France. It is part of the group Écoles Centrale which are also a great network for research and business.
At the École Centrale, the students are educated in multiple fields of engineering and therefore the graduates end up working in many different fields. Nonetheless, the main focus of the education
is to provide technical knowledge to the student to make it an engineer driven by innovation and aiming to reach optimization in all kind of processes.

he main way to integrate École Central de Lille is to take a competitive exam after 2-3 years of undergrade studies in a prepartory class. The written exam is usually composed of: 2 tests i Mathematics, 
2 tests in Physics, 1 in Science of Engineering, 1 in Chemistry, 1 in English and 1 in French/Philosophy. The same kind of tests are repeated during a second round that take place orally.
