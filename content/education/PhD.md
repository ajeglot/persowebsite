## Introduction

The objective of this research project was to optimize nitrogen removal from contaminated agricultural drainage water during the winter when water temperature are low.<br>
The idea of the project was to first identify the active microbial commmunities in the biological treatment unit (also referred as bioreactor), then select native and non-native 
microbial species to be reinjected in the ecosystem to enhance nitrogen removal.<br>
Therefore, during this project, I investigated the biochemistry and the microbial ecology of the ecosystem. Then I focused on microbial (bacterial and fungal) selection for bioaugmentaiton purposes.
During the last part of the study, I monitored the impact of injecting native and non native microbial communities in bioreactors to assess the efficiency of the method.


## Experience at Aarhus University

My experience at Aarhus University was divided in 2 stays. I first joined the research group of Soil Fertility to learn the methods associated with carbon and nitrogen analyses.
I conducted many preliminary experiments assessing the nitrogen removal in the bioreactors and starting enrichment cultures to monitor nitrogen removal of the active bacterial species.
The methods I used included Gas Chromatography, Liquid Chromatography, Colorimetric assays, Spectrophotometry and bacterial counts. 
During my second stay, I designed and supported for the construction of pilot scale bioreactors. Subsequently, I operated the pilot plant facility to test different injection methods
still with the aim to improve biological nitrogen removal from water.

## Experience at Novozymes

At Novozymes, I was collaborating with researchers from the department of Microbial Discovery. In this department, they are mainly focused in identifying 
novel enzymes from wild strains and clone them to assess their performances in specific conditions. I was trained in microbial screening, isolation, visual taxonomic identification, 
DNA based identification, genome reading, microbiome studies, qPCR, Mass Spectrophotometry, Flow cytometry NGS sequencing, metagenomics. I designed many experiments aiming at comparing
microbial growth performances in order to select the best candidates for bioaugmentation. 

At Novozymes, it was passionating to conduct microbial screening from wild enrichment cultures and identify all the different bacteria growing on the plates. It was a real playground 
to see how diverse growth conditions (light, temperature, media composition, oxic conditions) would provide the opportunity to isolate different bacteria. It was also very interesting
to isolate fungi from environmental samples such as soil and Woodchips. Realizing the fungal diversity in very spoil samples was striking, and the diversity of shapes and colors opened my
eyes on my ignorance. Thus, it was a pleasure to read more on the topic and gain knowledge on the fungal world. I conducted a study comparing mainly Basidiomycete to indentify the fastest grower
on a minimal media supplemented with wood dust. Three fungal strains were selected and tested at the pilot facility to investigate how much a fungal inoculation on the woodhcip would promote carbon degradation
and therefore enhance biological activity.

A big part of my activities at Novozymes was focused on genomic analyses. I conducted numerous DNA extraction, PCR product preparation for Tagmentation (16s and ITS), library preparation for NGS 
sequencing. Learn more about my experience on the page dedicated to my work at Novozymes.


## Motivation for the study

Nitrogen (N) is an essential element to support life along with Carbon (C), Oxygen (O) and Sulphur (S). It is a component of DNA, RNA and proteins, making it necessary for growth
of all living organisms. The main pool of nitrogen on earth is dinitrogen (N2) gas making up 79% of the atmosphere. Yet, relatively few organisms are able 
to fix and incorporate N2, which necessitates nitrogenase enzyme complexes converting N2 into ammonia (NH3) for subsequent transformation to organic N. Due to the stability of the
triple bond in N2, the biological N fixation is energetically costly. Most organisms depend on the use of reactive forms of N such as ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-), nitrate (NO3-),
nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and organically bound N. Thus, it is easier for living organisms to convert N to gas rather than using N in gas form. Nitrogen is one of the 
limiting nutrients in many soil ecosystems especially in agriculture where crops have a high need for N. Since the industrial revolution, the addition of reactive N in agricultural 
fields have rapidly increased globally (Galloway et al., 2003; Smil, 1997; Fowler et al., 2013). Canfield et al. (2010) estimated that the anthropogenic contribution to N fixation on 
earth in 2008 was 45%, including 30% from the Haber-Bosch process, 10% from the cultivation of N-fixing crops (mainly legumes) and 5% indirectly by the combustion of fossil fuels.

Unfortunately, the use of N-fertilizers to boost crop growth also increases the discharge of N to natural ecosystems. N in the form of NO3- leaches from agricultural fields to
drainage systems, ending up in freshwater and coastal water ecosystems. An overload of N deeply affects the receiving water bodies and surrounding terrestrial ecosystems
by enhancing eutrophication, acidification, algal blooms, hypoxia and loss of biodiversity

At the European level, this challenge has been identified more than 20 years ago and acknowledged in the Water Framework Directive in 2000 (EC, 2000). In this directive, the European Council 
recognized water as a heritage and not a resource and identified the need to keep healthy water bodies and prevent NO3- pollution. Since then, the European Council has updated the regulations 
on a regular basis, including the setting of thresholds for NO3- concentration in surface waters to 50 mg L-1 (EU, 2016; EU, 2010). Denmark is especially sensitive to NO3- pollution since 62% of 
the land is cultivated and over 50% of the agricultural fields are artificially drained (Møller et al., 2018). In Denmark, action plans have been implemented for almost 40 years to mitigate N 
leaching in natural ecosystems (Kronvang et al., 2008) with a current goal to be able to reduce N emission to coastal waters by 13 tons N per year in 2027 (Vandplanlægning, 2021).
In fact, many different technologies have been identified to mitigate the surcharge of N in natural ecosystems due to current agricultural practices (Hoffmann et al., 2020). These	4 mitigation 
technologies are considered passive compared to current technologies used in wastewater treatment since they do not rely on mixing or additional C supply. As of today, the most common 
N mitigation systems are constructed wetlands, riparian buffers and woodchip bioreactors (WBRs) (Schipper et al., 2010). Constructed wetlands have been assessed as an effective technology to remove 
N from point source (farm drains, industrial and domestic effluents) and nonpoint source discharges (agricultural run-off and drained water) (Vymazal, 2007). WBRs are constructed wetlands focused 
on NO3- removal. They were first investigated by Seidel (1955) in Germany and the research to improve the functioning of these systems spread around the world with main contributions from the USA, 
New Zealand, Canada, Sweden and Denmark. WBR facilities have been chosen to treat NO3- from agricultural run-offs mainly due to their high NO3- removal efficiency, their low-cost and low maintenance 
compared to other technologies (Schipper et al., 2010). In Denmark, the government decided to fund the construction of WBRs facilities on farmers land to promote the use of the technology 
(Vandplanlægning, 2016), increasing the need for research to keep optimizing the technology.

WBRs are designed to provide anoxic conditions favoring the occurrence of heterotrophic denitrification. Woodchips were chosen to be a long lasting C source and so far their longevity to sustain 
efficient NO3- removal has been assessed to be about 10 years (Robertson, 2010). Denitrification is a respiration process using NO3- as electron acceptor and the process is conducted mainly by 
facultative anaerobic and heterotrophic bacteria, i.e., using an organic C source as electron donor (Tiedje, 1994). It is a stepwise process converting NO3- to N2 facilitated sequentially by the enzymes: NO3- reductase, NO2- reductase, NO reductase and N2O reductase (Knowles, 1982). WBRs have consistently showed high N annual removal efficiencies over 50% (Christianson et al., 2012; Hoffmann et al., 2019), with near complete NO3- removal under optimized conditions (Griessmeier et al., 2021).
Unfortunately, NO3- removal efficiencies drop significantly to 10-20% at low drainage water temperature (David et al., 2016; Hoffmann et al., 2019; Maxwell et al., 2020; Roser et al., 2018). 
Moreover, low temperature often occurs during the peak of the drainage season in temperate climates, right when the highest load of N is actually discharged from agricultural land 
(Andersen et al., 2006). This reduced NO3- removal efficiency has mainly been attributed to slower microbial processes at low temperature. Therefore, a popular, but so far understudied 
idea is to enhance NO3- removal efficiency at low water temperature by influencing the composition and/or the functioning of the microbial community (Anderson et al., 2020; Jang et al., 2019) 
through two technologies referred as bioaugmentation and biostimulation (El Fantroussi and Agathos, 2005).

To date, the amount of microbiological studies on WBRs remains limited. Some studies have investigated the impacts of varying wood types, NO3- concentration and pesticide 5
contamination in relation to the presence and activity of specific microbes (Abdi et al., 2020; Griessmeier and Gescher, 2018; Griessmeier et al., 2017; Hellman et al., 2021; Nordstrom et al., 2021), 
but a more complete picture is lacking. Therefore, the present thesis aims to contribute to build this knowledge, determining the microbial composition of WBRs and assessing the potential for 
microbial management.


## Studies outline

This short chapter of the thesis aims to provide a further practical overview of the different studies and an idea of how they were conducted.

**Study I**

The purposes of this study was to get an overview of the WBRs microbial community composition, assess the similarities between different WBRs facilities and identify the 
main denitrifying microbial communities. This study was conducted in collaboration with Senior Researcher Joachim Audet from the Department of Ecoscience at Aarhus University. 
This Department of Aarhus University operate several full scale WBRs (Bruun et al., 2016b; Bruun et al., 2016a; Bruun et al., 2017; Carstensen et al., 2019; Hoffmann et al., 2019; 
Carstensen et al., 2020), and Dr. Joachim Audet supplied woodchip material collected from three different full-scale WBRs.
It was agreed that triplicate samples would be taken at three different locations along the flow path of the water in the WBRs: close to the inlet, at the middle and close to the 
outlet (Fig. 4.1). With that method, we obtained a representative sampling of the microbial population throughout the whole WBR to compare the microbial community dynamics along 
the flow path. The triplicate samples were then pooled together and metagenomics analyzes were conducted at Novozymes A/S to investigate microbial community compositions, abundance 
and activity. The methods related to this study and the results have been published in Paper I and in Audet et al. (2021).

**Study II**

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of temperature on denitrifying activity in WBRs. The method chosen was to start several enriched cultures (Fig. 4.2) 
originating from samples collected from the same WBR at different seasons during the year. Then controlled laboratory assays were carried out to observe the influence of temperature 
on the enriched microbial cultures growth and denitrification activity (NO3- removal and N2O production in assays with acetylene as inhibitor of N2O reductase). Metagenomics were 
conducted at Novozymes A/S on the different enriched cultures to assess the differences in microbial community compositions. The methods and the results from this study were published 
in Paper II.

**Study II**

Bacterial isolation were repeatedly conducted from the microbial communities enriched during study 2 and from microbial communities enriched from soil where high denitrification 
activity had been observed (Petersen et al., 2020) (Fig. 4.3). Cultivating the diluted enriched microbial cultures on agar plates supplied with NO3- (5 mM) at different temperatures 
(5, 10, 24 ℃), allowed for isolation of numerous bacterial strains (Fig. 4.4). The taxonomy of the bacterial isolates was identified using Sanger sequencing targeting the16S rRNA gene.
Potential psychrotolerant denitrifying bacteria were selected for further assays to identify the best candidates for denitrification and their whole genomes were sequenced. Further 
assays challenged the strains growth by cultivating them at low temperatures (5 and 10 ℃) and by supplying various C sources (acetate or water soluble C from woodchip) in a 
denitrifying medium under anoxic and oxic conditions. The selection process resulted in choosing two bacterial strains that were then tested as bioaugmentation inoculum at laboratory 
scale at low temperatures (5 and 10 ℃). The methods and the results from this study were published in Paper III.

**Study IV**

A pilot plant located at Aarhus University at Foulum, Denmark, was designed for this study. It was composed of a 12 m3 cooling tank connected through tubing and peristatic pumps to 
nine replicated WBRs (Fig. 4.5). Synthetic drainage water was kept in the cooling tank at a temperature of 5 ℃ and a nominal concentration of 55 mg NO3- L-1, and used as inlet water 
for the WBRs. The injection of a pre-grown selected bacterial denitrifying mixed culture (bioaugmentation) (Fig. 4.6) and the injection of additional C source (biostimulation) were 
studied in two experiments. NO3- removal and GHG emissions were measured to assess the performance of the WBRs. Additionally, woodchip and water samples were collected to conduct 
genomic analyzes to understand microbial dynamics in the bioreactors during bioaugmentation. Genomic studies were conducted at Novozymes A/S and at the Environmental Microbial Genomics 
Laboratory in Lyon. The methods and the results from these studies have been summarized in Paper IV and Paper V.

## Perspectives

Further studies should be encouraged to establish the link between the performance of field scale WBRs and their environmental settings. 
Investigating the effect of agricultural drainage waters biochemical and microbial composition on NO3- removal efficiency and on the microbial community 
composition would greatly contribute to the understanding of WBRs ecosystems. For example, one could investigate the reason for the omnipresence of the genus 
Flavobacterium in these ecosystems, or the effect the chemical composition of the inlet agricultural drainage water on microbial community composition and function. 
Similarly, investigating the effects of monthly temperature and flow changes on the microbial community composition in WBRs would contribute to unravel the microbial 
dynamics and indicate if the stability of the microbial community conducting NO3- removal in WBRs is due to high functional redundancy or to a few key taxa. Moreover, 
with the emergent and increasing data on WBRs microbiome composition around the world, a comparative review study gathering these data would help to identify the general 
drivers shaping the microbial community composition in WBRs.

In study 3, the potential of bioprospecting to obtain microorganisms for bioremediation in engineered systems was highlighted. Certainly, more strains could be tested and 
likely some more competitive strains could be found. The creation of a mixed microbial community focused on lignocellulosic degradation and denitrification could be the 
targeted goal instead 91 of intending to use single strains. The method proposed during this study as a proof of concept for bioaugmentation was simple, but in the future 
one could focus on creating more elaborate methods to assess the potential of multiple strains for bioaugmentation. These methods could be high throughput methods testing 
the potential of the strains to use different carbon sources, the antibiotics produced by the strain (showing its competitiveness in the ecosystem), its potential to create 
biofilms and the symbiosis between strains.

Finally, research on the temperature restricted bioremediation in denitrifying WBRs can still be advanced in various areas, such as: identification and dosing of relevant C 
sources enhancing NRRs and minimizing NH4+ production; bioaugmentation of WBRs targeting the solid phase using bacterial and fungal candidates with diverse inoculating vehicles; 
and application of press disturbances affecting the microbial community to enhance NRRs at low temperature. Future studies should be focused on obtaining a persistent effect of 
bioaugmentation on the microbial composition of the solid phase (biofilms on woodchips) or towards introducing microorganisms by use of vehicles that allow for continued metabolic 
activity and decrease the risk of washout.

## Exchange

During my PhD I also obtained a mobility grant from the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO). Therefore,
I had the chance to collaborate closely with Professor Tim Vogel and PhD Concepcion Sanchez at the Laboratory of Environmental Genomics in Lyon, France.
During this collaboration we conducted various analyses on some samples from a previously conducted pilot scalre experiment. More precisely, we looked at the 
microbial composition of the samples (Metagenomic analyses based on DNA and cDNA) and the quantity of specific organisms and genes with qPCR methods. We reconstructed genomes 
thanks to the Metagenomic data using Anvi'o. All in all, I developped my skills in hands-on molecular biology practices and bioinformatics (Dada2 with R, Anvi'o with Bash, Web scrapping with Python).
