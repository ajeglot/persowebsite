## Introduction

The Environmental Engineering master program at DTU is one of the oldest in Europe. A student in this program can follow various study lines that are determined by the electives chosen.
For my part I follow the study line referred as Residual Resource Engineering. During my studies at DTU, other than the mandatory courses I focused on water treatment and bioenergy production.

## Master thesis

I conducted my master thesis project with Irini Angelidaki as my main supervisor and Ioannis Fotidis as my co-supervisor.
The title is "Novel cultivation strategies of ammonia tolerant methanogenic consortia focused on: microbial growth, density and preservability".
In short, high levels of ammonia are inhibiting the conversion of organic matter to methane in the anaerobic digestion process. To alleviate what is referred
as ammonia inhibition, bioaugmentation of ammonia tolerant methanogenic consortia was investigated in the group where I studied. This novel technology proven effective,
I got hte challenge to investigate ways to bring this technology to larger scale, from laboratory scale to pilot and field scale. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to optimize the cultivation
of the ammonia tolerant methanogenic consortia, the concentration and the preservability.

Therefore, I optimized the cultivation of the microbial cultures by comparing various fed-batch cultivation strategies. Then I tested the upconcentration method with the use of forward osmosis
membranes. And finally, I entraped the mirocbial cultures in a gel to preserve them.<br>
The results from the study have demonstrated: a production of high volume (2 L) of concentrated inoculum with the fed-batch cultivation method under mesophilic conditions
(20% more concentrated than batch cultivation method); a reduction of the inoculum volume (at a rate of 24 mL.h-1) along with an increase of the cells concentration (increase of 10%TSS.h-1 on average)
with the up-concentration method involving forward osmosis; and a viable preservation method with agar gel (90% survival of the entrapped cells).

One peer reviewed scientific articles was published based on the work conducted during this study (see below "Scientific Articles").

And I received the Veolia Performance Trophy in 2018 for the quality of the report and the presentation my M.S. thesis.
