## Introduction

Flow Loop is a Danish startup based in the north of Copenhagen, Allerod, Denmark. Started by a design engineer from DTU in 2016, this startup is developping, producing and selling
water recycling shower systems. The first trial of the system happend in 2018 at the festival Roskilde happening in Denamrk. The startup really started to soar when a new CEO, Troels Grene
arrived and involved the startiup in a bootcamp at IKEA of SWEDEN. Since then, a close partnership with IKEA has been going on until IKEA invested in the startup in 2022.

In brief, the Flow Loop shower is a system sucking the water directly from the floor, then it filters the water to remove suspended solids (at micron levels) and sterilizes the water using 
UV desinfection. This system allows for water savings up to 70% and energy savings up to 80%.

## My mission at Flow Loop

I was hired at Flow Loop as a water quality expert. Because of the reuse of water densely concentrated in bacteria, it is paramount to monitor carefully the filtration and the desinfection 
in the system. Additionnaly, microbial growth occurs in the system during the shower and especially between showers.
Therefore, my mission as the water quality expert at Flow Loop was to ensure the safety of the users acting on three main areas:
- Microfiltration
- Desinfection
- Cleaning of the system or CIP

## Microfiltration

When I started at Flow Loop the microfiltration used was a polypropylene pleated filter with a 10 micrometers mesh. This filtration technology is commonly used in spas (hot tubs). 
The efficiency of the filtration with these pleated filter cartridges is very good and most of the suspended solids are removed during the water recirculating shower. However, this technology is not suited for 
the intensive use of a shower system. And after 150 showers on average, equivalent to a month of use by a family of 4, the filter cartridge has been accumulating so much dirt and promoting so much microbial growth
that the smell emanating from it prevents the continuation of its use.<br>
This effect is unhappy because the physical performance of this filter even after the month of use is still great: high flow rate, low differential pressure and filtration of suspended solids.
Nonetheless, because of the smell the filter needs to be changed and throw away without recycling. Additionnaly, it is safer for the user to change filter at that point because the spent filter
cartridge is slowly becoming a microbial source 

In the frame of the development project with IKEA, eventually leading to the industrial production of a system to be sold in IKEA shops, it was key to find a more sustainable solutions.
Using a one time use filter for a month and throwing it away without recycling does not fit the sustainable image of the product and neither the circular agenda at IKEA.<br>
Therefore, I was charged to investigate alternative filtration technologies that could replace the current one. For this project, IKEA and Flow Loop contracted two consultants from the company 
AFRY to support me. One of my colleagues, Simon Allin also supported during this project in the workshop during the bench testing and for some desing development including mainly the filter housing.

Six main technologies were rested to improve the lifetime of the filtration in the system:
- Cleaning by ozonation
- Cleaning by ultrasonic wave
- Active drying between showers using a centrifugal fan
- Combination of filters including activated carbon and nylon mesh filters
- Backflushing of a metal filter

During the bench test, artificial shower water (grey water coming from the shower) was elaborated to simulate actual shower water in replicable conditions.
This arificial shower water was run through the filtration technologies and the performance of the technologies were assessed based on physical parameters (flow rate, differential pressure),
chemical composition (Total Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen) and microbial build up (Heterotrophic Plate Count at 22 celcius).

Eventually, the test showed that the two technologies ensuring a longer lifetime of the filter were the active drying of the filter, which displayed the best results in term of microbial growth
prevention, and the metal filter, which were found to be resettable with regular backwashing and out of place cleaning (by hand or in a dishwasher).

## Disinfection

UV mercry disinfection (wavelength of 253.7 nm) remains a cheap and reliable way to disinfect water. The rise of UV LED has not yet been able to compete cost wise with mercury UV.
Therefore, several projects were started with UV LED manufacturers and suppliers to develop a UV LED reactor that would answer the disinfection need of the Flow Loop system
as well as being competitive with UV mercury. For example, a development project was conducted with the Swedish startup Waterspint.

Several tests were conducted to compare UV reactors efficiency and lifetime. These tests were based on microbial analyses with a focus on hetrerotrophic bacteria (HPC22) and coliform bacteria (one of the most persistent family
of bacteria in wastewater). It was clear that most of the UV technologies provided a log4 reduction for tested microbial concentrations. The aim was to assess the need in terms of exposure time to conduct the 
required disinfection. Most technologies showed great disinfection performances, therefore the driving parameter to choose a technology was cost.

## System cleaning

Over the time, the use of the recycling shower system promotes biofilm growth within the hydraulic system. This microbial growth of the system is mainly found in the recirculating loop
of the system: suction inlet, filter, mixed water tank, UV and head shower. The build up of microbes was observed mainly in the piping and on the filter surface.
To prevent long term build up of biofilm, it is recommended to clean the system every 100 showers. 
The first cleaning in place procedure elaborated for the Flow Loop recirculating shower systen was based on using a chlorine tablet that would be recirculated through the system for 6 minutes.
Microbial analyses were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the cleaning protocol and its resilience. The results showed a significant reduction in microbial load in the sytem following
the clenaing procedure. However, the microbial counts came back to initial values after 3 days, highlighting the very low resilience of the procedure.

Based on these results, new clenaing technologies were investigated including:
- Enzymes. More especially a protease and a nuclease products provide by Novozymes A/S
- Ultrapure water
- Electrolyzed water with a concentration of 100 mgCl/L
- Salt based cleaning agent provided by the company Aquafinesse

During these tests, the effect of the cleaning agents was studied with the use of dirty filters. Assessing how much microbial removal could be conducted from the dirty filters.
The results suprinsingly pointed out that the current chlorine procedure was the best at decrease the microbial load in the water coming out of the filtration.
However, it is clear that some of the technology should not be used as shock protocol but more as prevention methods. 

It was later decided, based on external advice, to test a stronger cleaning agent used in spas and especifically tagetting biofilms. The preliminary test of this pipe cleaning 
agent was encouraging. The replicated cleaning tests with this method showed a better intial cleaning as well as a longer resilient effect.
