## Student helper at COWI 2017-2018

During my Master's in Environmental Engineering at DTU, Denmark. I had the chance to work at COWI as a student helper. The team I integrated was conducting soil mapping projects preceding
 the construction of infrastructures. Therefore, a team of 2 to 4 workers was going on the field to measure parameters such as soil resistivity and seismic properties of the soil. The soil resistivty was
measured with long cables equipped with numerous electrodes that would receive the refracted electrical current on the different layers composing the soil. Another method was the detonation of a bullet in the 
soil and the measure of the seismic shock waves. I took part in both field work and data analysis in this team for a year before finishing my Master's.


## Agricultural internship in organic farming in India 2017

During the summer of 2017, I went to India for 2 months to discover the culture and learn organic farming at Navdanya. Navdanya is a NGO located close to Deradhun in Uttarakhand, India.
This NGO is led by Vandana Shiva who is a peaceful climate activit. During my time at the farm, I learn how to grow rice, legumes and citrus trees in respect of the environment. This was a community 
experience where everyday we were contributing to the farm work as well as the cooking cleaning and self teaching. As an engineer I also had the chance to share with my fellow interns and learn from them as well.
This experience really raised my awareness on the topics such as land ownership, nature protection, seeds diversity and preservation.

## Intern in the Energy and Climate Unit at Artelia 2016

For my last internship durng my Master's in Industrial Engineering I integrated the Energy and Climate unit at Artelia. This unit is composed of consultants working on advising
public institutions such as municipalities and regions in France on how to plan the energy transition. They provide recommendations on which type of renewable they should install and where
for example. During this internship I was in charge of developping a predictive tool for energy consumption in given regions. I develop this tool using VBA based on electricity consumption data.
I also contributed to customers meetings by summarizing national regulations and future development goals.


## Intern assessing risk of water scarcity in Lima 2015

During the summer of 2015, I took the chance to travel to Peru and collaborate with a researcher, Doctor Modesto Montoya, and investigate the risk of water scarcity in Lima.
I spent time looking at hydrogeological maps with engineers from the INGEMMET and looking at water treatment capabilities in Lima to assess the water ressource and their management.
We defined the main water paths to the city and the replenishing cycles for potable water. It was obvious the inequalities in water access depending on the social class and the living area.
However, ultimately, we concluded that Lima was not at risk of water scarcity crisis because of the high supply of water from the nearby mountainous areas.

## Intern at a construction site at La Defense with Artelia 2014

During my first year at the Engineering school Centrale Lille, I join the project management team for the renovation of a tower at La Defense, France.
My role was to optimized some tools in the Microsoft Office package used by the team to follow tasks and produce reports. It was a great insight into the field of construction, I could observe
and take part in the communication between the numerous actors and get a good understanding of the process to renovate such a big building.
